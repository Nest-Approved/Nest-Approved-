  "title": "Inspect foundation vents (if present)",
  "why": "Open vents affect moisture and energy performance.",
  "look": "Damage, missing covers, improper seasonal position.",
  "note": "Many vents should remain closed year-round."
},
{
  "title": "Inspect sump pump operation",
  "why": "Spring snowmelt stresses drainage systems.",
  "look": "Proper discharge, abnormal noise, failure to run.",
  "note": "Test by adding water, not lifting the float."
},
{
  "title": "Check sump discharge location",
  "why": "Improper discharge recirculates water back to foundation.",
  "look": "Short discharge, frozen lines, crushed piping.",
  "note": "Discharge should extend well away from the home."
},
{
  "title": "Inspect basement and crawlspace floors",
  "why": "Seepage often appears during spring thaw.",
  "look": "Damp spots, efflorescence, standing water.",
  "note": "White powder indicates chronic moisture."
},
{
  "title": "Inspect interior ceilings and walls",
  "why": "Winter roof leaks may show up late.",
  "look": "Stains, peeling paint, bubbling drywall.",
